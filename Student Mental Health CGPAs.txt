**Hypothesis**:  Does Mental health conditions or other factors like age and major affect students cumulative grade point average (CGPAs)?

**Variables:**

- Cumulative grade point average (CGPA)
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Panic Disorder
- Treated students
- Age
- Major


**Why I chose this topic:** I currently work as an Enrollment Advisor and I see many variables that affect student sucess and I wanted to know what role mental health plays for the student to better support them sucessfully completing their programs with higher cumulative grade point average (CGPAs).

##Interpreting regression coefficients:The statsmodel Linear regresson does not show a correlation between the variables in CGPAs.
#According this the stats model we can reject the null hypothesis since each variable is lower than the signicance level 0.05.

# Relevant insights

# Insights: Analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between those with mental health issues and those without.  CGPAs were pretty similiar amongst the 7,000 students regardless of mental health status.

# Thus we can reject the null hypothesis that mental health was a significant feature for student's CGPAs.

# Age and major were the only factors that stood out in the study. In regards to age and major, we cannot regret the null hypthesis.
