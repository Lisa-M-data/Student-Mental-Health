# Student-Mental-Health
This repository will look at how students mental health affects cumulative grade point averages of student in higher Ed. It will also look at age and major to see if there is any correlation between these factors using Python coding language.

Analysis of higher ed. student mental health and CGPAs
Hypothesis:  Does Mental health conditions or other factors like age and major affect students cumulative grade point average (CGPAs)?

Variables:

- Cumulative grade point average (CGPA)
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Panic Disorder
- Treated students
- Age
- Major


Why I chose this topic: I currently work as an Enrollment Advisor and I see many variables that affect student sucess and I wanted to know what role mental health plays for the student to better support them sucessfully completing their programs with higher cumulative grade point average (CGPAs).

Relevant insights
Insights: Analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between those with mental health issues and those without. CGPAs were pretty similiar amongst the 7,000 students regardless of mental health status.
Thus we can reject the null hypothesis that mental health was a significant feature for student's CGPAs.
Age and major were the only factors that stood out in the study. In regards to age and major, we cannot regret the null hypthesis.
