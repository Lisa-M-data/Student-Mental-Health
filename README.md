# Project Scope of Work: 

This repository will look at how students' mental health affects the cumulative grade point averages of students in higher education. It will also look at age and major to see if there is any correlation between these factors using the Python coding language.

Analysis of higher ed. student mental health and CGPAs
Hypothesis:  Do mental health conditions or other factors like age and major affect students' cumulative grade point average (CGPAs)?

# Variables:

- Cumulative grade point average (CGPA)
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Panic Disorder
- Treated students
- Age
- Major


# Why I chose this topic: 
I currently work in an upskilling program, and I see many variables that affect student success. I wanted to know what role mental health plays for the student to better support them in completing their programs with a higher cumulative grade point average (CGPA).

# Code features:
- Numpys
- Pandas
- Statsmodel Mutliple variable
- Chi2 Crosstab Analytis
- Random Forest Regression Model

# Relevant insights
Insights: Analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between those with mental health issues and those without. CGPAs were pretty similar amongst the 7,000 students regardless of mental health status.
Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis that mental health was a significant feature for students' CGPAs.
Age and major were the only factors that stood out in the study. In regard to age and major, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
