# Student-Mental-Health
This reposistoriy will look at how student mental health affects cumulative grade point averages of student in higher Ed. It will also look at age and major to see if there is any correlation between these factors.

Analysis of higher ed. student mental health and CGPAs
Hypothesis**:  Does Mental health conditions or other factors like age and major affect students cumulative grade point average (CGPAs)?

Variables:

- Depression
- Anxiety

- Treated students
- Age
- Major


Why I chose this topic: I currently work as an Enrollment Advisor and I see many variables that affect student sucess and I wanted to know what role mental health plays for the student to better support them sucessfully completing their programs with higher cumulative grade point average (CGPAs).
